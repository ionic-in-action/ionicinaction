Last month I gave a talk at Powered By Javascript, Manning's first conference, about the Ionic Framework. I walk through what Ionic is, how it works, and demo a pretty feature rich example. There are also some pretty good questions at the end.

If you are new to Ionic it is a great way to get a high level overview of the technology and what it can provide. The quality of hybrid mobile apps build with Ionic is quite impressive, and with your own creativity you can easily generate some pretty amazing mobile apps.

In the last question I was incorrect in my statements about IndexedDB in iOS8. It is available, though there are some problems.
