A new early access book at Manning has just come out that you will want to have on your shelf as you become a master hybrid app developer.

If you use the code **mlcamden** at checkout, you can get 50% off of this new book! Get it at [http://manning.com/camden](http://www.manning.com/camden?a_aid=ionicinaction).

Ionic in Action uses Cordova, so this is the ideal book to dig deeper into how to build Ionic apps that have great platform integration.
